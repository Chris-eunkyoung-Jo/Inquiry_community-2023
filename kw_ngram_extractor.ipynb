I would further like to remind your side that the only important places in the draft Armistice Agreement where there is not an agreement on the meaning of the wording are those places where\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0007.txt:On 28 April the United Nations Command submitted to your side our compromise proposal for an armistice. Naturally, our side accepts the wording of the draft Armistice Agreement which we submitted at that time. We further stated that we would not accept any substantive changes in our proposal. With the exception of one minor change in paragraph 40b, which I will refer to later, the United Nations Command is satisfied with the wording of all the paragraphs as they appear in the draft of the Armistice Agreement presented to you on 28 April.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0010.txt:COL SOMERVILLE: I would like to make something clear right now. When my Senior Delegate reluctantly agreed to these staff officers meetings he said: \"Our respective staffs can explore such matters as may offer a hope for further progress.” And he also said: \"It is to be hoped that in the staff meetings you will be able to propose something that may be useful in leading to an armistice.\" The wording of your request for these staff meetings and the instructions that you received from your Senior Delegate have no binding effect on our side. I do not know what instructions you have received, but I am bound by the instructions I receive from the Senior Delegate of the United Nations Command Delegation.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0011.txt:COL SOMERVILLE (Cont’d) : With respect to paragraph 52, there was agreement in principle, but not on the detailed wording. You state that your side did not comment when the United Nations Command presented its 28 April version of the draft Armistice Agreement. The 28 April version of the draft Armistice Agreement differs in no important respect from the version on which General Hsieh Fang of your side on 3 April made the following comments: \"Except for the only remaining major question of the nomination of Neutral Nations, the staff officers meetings on Agenda Item 3 have solved the overwhelming majority of the questions on Agenda Item 3 and have specifically formulated the overwhelming majority of paragraphs and sub-paragraphs of the draft Armistice agreement. I formally propose that the sub-committee approve the agreements reached by the staff officer meetings and also record our appreciation of the work done by the staff officers of both sides. Regarding the technical questions of terminology which the staff officers have not been able to resolve, I suggest that they be left to be settled by the interpreters of both sides at a later date, and I think it would not be difficult for these questions to be settled.\"\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0014.txt:COL SOMERVILLE: We would still like to have the versions both in Chinese and in Korean as we originally requested.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0016.txt:COL CHANG: We are now handing you in writing the wording of \"Korea\" and the \"United Nations Forces\" which will be used in the Korean version of the draft Armistice Agreement, which we discussed yesterday, and I would like to add that this has nothing to do with the English and Chinese versions. (Hands Colonel Somerville document - see Enclosure 1)\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0017.txt:COL SOMERVILLE: Your statement is clear, but I would like to ask whether we will not save time by agreeing that the present draft wording of paragraph 37 accomplishes what you propose to submit tomorrow. The present draft of paragraph 37 refers to two neutrals nominated by each side: by the United Nations Command, Sweden and Switzerland; by your side, Czechoslovakia and Poland. It would seem that the draft already contains the names of the nations which you have mentioned and if you could agree to the present wording, which we agree to, we would then have eliminated this paragraph from any further discussions.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0021.txt:Due to the scarcity of Korean and Chinese-speaking nationals among the personnel of the Neutral Nations it will be mutually beneficial to your side and ours if the last sentence of paragraph 40b is amended by inserting the words \"except interpreters\" after the words \" provided, however, that such personnel......\" The amended sentence would then read as follows: \"The Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission may provide itself and the Neutral Nations Inspection Teams with such of the above personnel and equipment of its own as it may desire; provided, however, that such personnel, except interpreters, shall be personnel of the same neutral nations of which the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is composed.\"\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0022.txt:COL CHANG: The day before yesterday, we submitted our views regarding the wording of \"Korea\" and the \"United Nations Command\" in the Korean version. If your side is prepared regarding this, our side would like to hear your views.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0022.txt:In the Item 3 discussions, our Senior Staff Officer on several occasions mentioned \"the problem of Korean terminology\" without specifying Chinese, but he never agreed that our side would use \"CHOSON\" in the Chinese version prepared by our side. We insist that the Chinese version prepared by our side use the term \"HAN KUO\" for \"Korea\". In the Chinese version prepared by your side, we agree to the use of the term \"CHOSON” to designate \"Korea.\"\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0023.txt:On 28 March, your side stated: \"Regarding the 'United Nations Forces', we will agree to your usage and we would like to have you agree to our usage of 'CHOSON'. We will be deferential and will agree to your idea to have the 'United Nations Forces' translated into the Korean language the way you would have it adopted, whereas we ask you to agree to the usage of the word ”CHOSON\".\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0024.txt:COL CHANG (CONT’D): the Chinese version should be one which the Chinese people use. This is the second point that I would like to call to your attention.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0025.txt:COL SOMERVILLE: That's what I proposed. I also proposed that our side would use the version that we have presented. I also stated that this did not prejudice our position on the translation of \"Korea\" and \"United Nations Command\".\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0026.txt:COL SOMERVILLE: With respect to your written comments on paragraphs 52 and 54, it would appear that your changes are either a matter of translation or the order of references. So long as changes of word order do not change the substance of the text, we have already indicated our willingness in other paragraphs that each side use that sequence of reference it prefers.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0026.txt:We would like to suggest that if there is real progress toward an armistice to be contributed by these staff officer meetings, we should address ourselves to valid problems, instead of suggesting changes of word sequence or translations of the same words every time they appear throughout the draft Armistice agreement. We have already agreed that so far as the sequence of referring to nationalities is concerned, each side will utilize its preference, when an agreement is ultimately reached on translating the words \"Korea\" and United Nations Command\", it will automatically\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0028.txt:Before we recess I would like to hand this letter from my Senior Delegate for your Senior Delegate to Colonel McCarthy. (Hands letter to Colonel McCarthy. See Memorandum for Record, Liaison Officers, 29 July 1952.)\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0033.txt:After examining the record of yesterday's conference, it appears to our side that there may have been an error of translation in your side's last remark concerning paragraph 37. It was the understanding of our side that your side had said: \"In my mind, also, it appears there is a little to be discussed further in this paragraph 37.\" We would like to know what the correct translation should be.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0034.txt:COL CHANG: We have nothing further to submit at this moment, but we would like to discuss items which were left unresolved at these staff officers meetings.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0034.txt:COL CHANG: Regarding the wording \"CHOSON\" and the question of translation of the terminology \"United Nations Forces\", our side has already expressed our views. Our side would like to hear your views regarding these.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0034.txt:Our side has not argued over your use of the title Korean People's Army\". We could have insisted with logic that your side use \"PUK HAN KUN\" meaning \"North Korean Army\", which would have been a much more descriptive name.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0034.txt:If we base our arguments according to your logic, our side would have maintained that the translation of the terminology \"United Nations Forces\" should be \"The United States Forces\" instead of calling it “KUK CHE YON HAP KUN\". Do you find any necessity for having further discussions of this kind?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0035.txt:COL SOMERVILLE: As we have said before, we also consider this preoccupation with terminology to be a minor issue. You say that we are, to use your expression, \"retracking\" ground already covered. I would like to remind your side that your Senior Delegate, on 3 July, formally accepted our wording of paragraph 51 and on 4 July stated that both sides agreed to the wording of paragraph 52. Yet yesterday you submitted changed versions of both paragraphs.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0036.txt:With respect to paragraph 52, which you have just referred to, I would like to quote your statement that you made on 27 July: “with respect to paragraph 52, there was agreement in principle but not in the detailed wording.\" Our side considers that you made this statement with full understanding of the facts brought out by the plenary session of the delegations. Therefore, what you have just said is not only contrary to the facts but also to the statement you made on 27 July.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0037.txt:With respect to paragraph 52, it is not clear to us what change in meaning you intend by your change in text. We would like to have further clarification of your position.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0041.txt:COL CHANG: I would like to speak.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0042.txt:COL CHANG: You say that yours is a very simple formula, but I doubt if you realize what would be the consequences if we use all the words that both sides want to use in the draft Armistice Agreement. From the start to the end, you insist upon an issue which does not and could not exist, under whatever reason, in the Chinese version. Perhaps I am only to understand that your side is not willing to resolve the question of the Korean terminology and translation of the wording \"United Nations Forces\", which makes obstacles to the readjustment to the entire draft Armistice Agreement.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0043.txt:COL MCCARTHY: As Liaison Officer, I would like to hand to Colonel Chang a letter from our Senior Delegate addressed to your Senior Delegate. (Hands letter to Colonel Chang - see Memorandum for Record, Liaison Officers, 31 July 1952)\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0048.txt:As I have indicated, we will accept two of the changes in paragraph 52 suggested by your side if you will accept the words \"shall not employ\"; we will then have agreed on the text of paragraph 52. Paragraph 52 would then read: \"Each side insures that it shall not employ in acts of war in the Korean conflict any prisoners of war released and repatriated incident to the armistice,\"\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0049.txt:COL CHANG (CONT'D): sure to insure that the prisoners of war shall not take part in acts of war in the Korean conflict again, our side cannot find that the wording of paragraph 52, as was proposed by our side, would create any difficulty.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0049.txt:Regarding the question of the translation of the words \"Korea\" and \"United Nations Command\", which has been the crux for a long time in these staff officers meetings, our side submitted yesterday a proposal which would resolve that question.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0049.txt:COL SOMERVILLE: Before I reply to your remarks on how to translate the word \"Korea\" and the words \"United Nations Command\", I would like to go back to my statement regarding the use of the words \"shall not employ\" in paragraph 52. I ask you to turn to paragraph 12 of the draft Armistice Agreement, the first sentence of which reads: \"The commanders of the opposing sides shall order and enforce a complete cessation of all hostilities in Korea by all armed forces under their control--etc.\" Your side has agreed to this paragraph. Obviously the paragraph was so worded because the commanders could not be made responsible for any person or any persons not under their control. This is precisely the point we make with regard to paragraph 52.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0050.txt:COL SOMERVILLE: I interpret your remarks to mean that you are not yet prepared to give your definite answers with respect to paragraph 400 and paragraph 52. If I have made an incorrect assumption, I would like to have you clarify your position.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0050.txt:I would also like to ask whether you are prepared to comment on, or agree to, our suggestion of yesterday regarding certain military terminology.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0051.txt:With respect to paragraph 40b, your side has already indicated that you would retract your proposed revision of this paragraph. Accordingly, our side does not consider any change is necessary in this paragraph.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0052.txt:COL CHANG (CONT 'D): the translation of \"United Nations Command\", I would like to repeat our stand on these; namely, if your side agrees to the wording \"CHOSON\" in the Chinese version which is to be prepared by both sides, our side thinks that in the Korean versions of the draft Armistice Agreement, our side will use the wording \"CHOSON\" and your side can use the wording \"HAN KUK\", and at the same time our side will be prepared to consider the inclusive use of the wording \"KUK CHE YON HAP KUN” in the Korean versions which will be prepared by both sides.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0052.txt:COL SOMERVILLE: It would appear that your willingness to use the words \"shall not employ\" in paragraph 52 resolves any substantial differences between our two sides on this paragraph. However, we note that you have changed slightly the last part of the paragraph which originally read \"incident to the Armistice to read \"incident to the coming into effect of this Armistice.\" Since there is no apparent difference in meaning, I would like to ask why you have changed the words.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0052.txt:With respect to your comments on our proposal regarding the differences in certain military terms, it would appear that your agreement that each side use the terms it desires, providing there is no change in the substance of the paragraphs\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0053.txt:With respect to paragraph 40b, you have misquoted our side, or there may have been an unintentional misrepresentation due to translation. We stated that we would not argue over our amendment to paragraph 400. Our proposed change, as I previously have stated, was not initiated for the benefit of the United Nations Command. It was a practical suggestion to ease the interpreter problems which the neutrals nominated by both sides will have to meet. It does not confer any advantage on one side at the expense of the other. In rejecting our practical suggestion, your side may well have added to the difficulties which will have to be solved by the neutral nations which your side has nominated. We will now withdraw our recommendation reference paragraph 40b.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0053.txt:I have several questions to ask about paragraph 60. In your proposed revision you omitted the word military before the word \"commanders\". Secondly, you changed the words “hereby recommend\" to \"shall recommend\". Thirdly, you changed the words \"the Armistice Agreement\" to \"this Armistice Agreement\", and lastly, you changed the words \"is signed and becomes effective\" to \"becomes effective\". We would like to have your reasons for each of these four changes.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0054.txt:COL CHANG: What I would like to repeat is that there exists no substantial difference between the original wording of the principle and the proposed wording of this paragraph. After we have made further consideration, we will give you answer to the questions in connection with this paragraph.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0054.txt:COL SOMERVILLE: So that there is no misunderstanding, I would like to restate our position of the moment. With respect to the four items we have discussed this morning: We withdraw our recommended amendment to paragraph 40b. We agree that your suggestion for each side to use its own preferred terms for certain military words removes any problem that cannot be solved by the interpreters of both sides. We withhold any statement of agreement on paragraph 52 and 60 for the time being.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0055.txt:COL SOMERVILLE: I agree that these are mainly matters for the interpreters to resolve. However, since agreement on paragraphs 52 and 60 is still to be reached, I suggest that we hold these translations in abeyance until we have definitely settled any question of text. I believe it would save time and confusion.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0057.txt:Yesterday we called to your attention the change in wording in paragraph 60, wherein you substituted the words \"shall recommend\" for \"hereby recommend.\" After we commented on the change of meaning which might be produced, you stated that you would give further consideration to this matter and would answer our question. Are you prepared to discuss this change further?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0058.txt:Now I would like to hand you copies of the draft Armistice Agreement in Korean, Chinese, and English, as worked out according to the agreement between both sides.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0058.txt:COL SOMERVILLE: Yesterday you agreed that we would probably save time and some confusion if we wait until we have resolved the questions of text, now narrowed down: to only paragraphs 52 and 60, before starting the interpreters to work. I still think that it is a sound decision and that we will actually save time. I therefore again suggest that we hold this matter in abeyance. Our side is willing to meet with your side again tomorrow in an effort to resolve the last few questions of text or such other matters as you may wish to bring up.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0059.txt:COL SOMERVILLE: I would like to make it clear that our offer to meet with you tomorrow is not based on any overwhelming desire on our part to keep these staff meetings going. Your side asked for these meetings, and it was our presumption, in agreeing to meet with your side, that you wanted them to continue until we made as much progress as possible on the subjects which were to be discussed. If your side is not inclined to meet tomorrow, we are willing to accede to your desires.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0059.txt:COL CHANG: Our side considers that the majority of the details of the wordings of the draft Armistice Agreement have been agreed upon already. So long as your side agrees to the wordings of paragraphs 52 and 60, our side wishes to give the drafts in three languages for your study. And if your side has any particular views which your side wishes to discuss, we would like to have the interpreters of both sides handle them.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0061.txt:COL CHANG: What I would like to know is what further points are you still considering in paragraph 60?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0062.txt:COL SOMERVILLE: When your side requested these meetings end indicated that their purpose was to resolve all questions of wording of the draft Armistice Agreement, we presumed, in acceding to your request, that we would keep open the opportunity for discussions until both sides bad agreed to all the disputed points of wording, or until it was evident that we had made all the progress possible. A firm agreement has not yet been reached by both sides on all paragraphs.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0062.txt:I fall to understand what points your side believes to be still at issue in paragraph 60. I wish that your side would express your views regarding this paragraph 60 at tomorrow's meeting.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0066.txt:COL CHANG: At the plenary session of the delegations, the Senior Delegate of our side clearly pointed out that, when the staff officers' meetings would be called for, their assignment would be discussing the details of the wording of the draft Armistice Agreement, and your Senior Delegate agreed to it.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0067.txt:What I would like to add is that this is not what your side calls a \"translation\" but is the draft Armistice Agreement in three languages which will be, legally, equally authentic.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0098.txt:Reference sub-paragraph 13a. The revision suggested for this sub-paragraph is based upon the change in tactical situation along the front lines, Since this sub-paragraph was first agreed upon over a year ago, extensive and heavy fortifications have been constructed in the area which will become the Demilitarized Zone. We are certain that the military forces would not have sufficient time in the 72 hours allowable to destroy all fortifications as presently required by this sub-paragraph,\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0098.txt:COL PU: Before your side proceeds on with the explanations, I would like, first, to make clear that we have made adequate explanation of our position as to the wording of paragraph 51, proposed by our side, we consider that there is no necessity to repeat it.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0098.txt:As to paragraph 13a, we would like to raise one question. That is, is the provision of armed troops, authorized a 90-day period to complete salvage operations, included in the 1000 personnel as provided in paragraph 10?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0099.txt:COL DARROW: What time would be suitable to your side?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0100.txt:We therefore recommend that an additional sentence be added to this paragraph. The paragraph would read: \"A Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is hereby established. The site of the headquarter of the Commission, which shall be located in a demilitarized zone between the two sides, shall have extra-territoriality.\"\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0101.txt:As to paragraph 52, we would like to reiterate what we have said this morning. That is, we hope that your side will seriously study and consider the wording proposed by our side so that agreement can be reached speedily,\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0106.txt:If General Hsieh Fang were here today, his answer to that statement would be: that logic is the same as to say black is white.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0109.txt:In order that both sides would not waste time on this question, we propose that your side seriously reconsider your opinion and accept the provision of paragraph 51 proposed by our side.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0110.txt:prisoners of war who insist upon repatriation will be directly repatriated. The second paragraph states in substance that the remaining prisoners will be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for disposition in accordance with the Terms of Reference. I would like to point out the second paragraph states and I quote, \"for disposition. It does not state \"for repatriation.\"\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0112.txt:I would like to make a correction in one of my statements this morning. I stated that \"the only agreement which has been reached is that which was signed by our two (2) Delegations on 8 June.\"\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0113.txt:I do not believe that it is necessary to discuss this matter further. Our side has clearly put forth its views regarding the issue involved. There is no doubt in my mind that your side completely understands the logic and the position which has been expressed by our side this morning. Any further discussion on this matter would be repetitious.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0114.txt:But, in the Terms of Reference for tic Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, which both sides have signed, there is no similar provision, Therefore, we would like to inquire what your opinion is as to how the travelling expenses of the personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in coming to Korea should be taken care of?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0116.txt:Now I would like to bear your views on our paragraph 51.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0117.txt:In this connection, I would like to point out that at the plenary session of the delegations of both sides on July 1, 1952, the Senior Delegate of your side made the following statements:\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0117.txt:\"Let us examine paragraph 51. Basically it states All prisoners of war held in the custody of each side at the time when this agreement becomes effective, shall be released and repatriated as soon as possible. Such release and repatriation shall be executed in accordance with the lists exchanged and checked by each side prior to the signing of the agreement, on This wording is in accordance with your principle of exchanging prisoners of war upon the signing of an armistice. It seems that tie wording from this paragraph is in the historical document and is agreeable to both sides although we would prefer one quite different.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0122.txt:COL JU: Yesterday I presented to you our formulations of three (3) paragraphs, Now, I would like to hear your views about then.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0123.txt:Paragraph 10 in the Terms of Reference which applies to such cases does not provide for any priority for sick and injured personnel. It seems to be that those prisoners in the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission who are sick and injured and who do make application for repatriation would be repatriated forthwith, and that there is no necessity for establishing any specific priority for the sick and injured prisoners in this category.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0124.txt:COL JU: (CONT') there is a phrase which says that to determine the location of the Military Demarcation Line we should show the latitude and longitudes but the view of our side is that we may not use latitude and longitude, Now I would like to hear your views about it.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0124.txt:I believe this particular problem should be solved by the staff group headed by Col. O and Col. Murray, since they have the function of proscribing the Military Demilitarization Line and the Demilitarized Zone, I believe that group would be more capable of determining how the line and the zone should be described. I will inform Col. Murray of your opinion. Once agreement is reached by the other staff group on this matter, we can undertake to rewrite paragraph 2 and 3 if it is necessary.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0124.txt:I would like to make an observation regarding sub-paragraphs 57a and d. It will be necessary to limit the reference specifically to paragraph 51a. The Terms of Reference in paragraph 12 cover the essential Red Cross service for prisoners of war in the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0128.txt:I would like your views on the necessity for including the phrase who insist upon repatriation in the three (3) paragraphs I have just discussed.\n",

            "Cleaned_data_8/0129.txt:In regard to the Terms of Reference, I would like your views in connection with changes that should be made therein, if necessary. Both sides have agreed that the Terms of Reference will be incorporated in the Armistice Agreement as an Annex. Our side believes that it will not be necessary or desirable to make any substantive changes in the Terms of Reference.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0131.txt:COL DARROW: (CONTD) I would like to discuss with logic and reason the first sentence which you propose. Our site interprets the first sentence to mean that all prisoners of war shall be released and repatriated. Our site interprets the Preamble, agreed upon by both sides, to mean that all those prisoners of war who insist upon repatriation shall be released and repatriated. Furthermore, the Preamble states that all remaining prisoners of war will be handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for disposition in accordance with the Terms of Reference. Our side cannot reconcile the two (2) Interpretations - that of the original first sentence and that of the Preamble to be the same thing. Would your side please explain how you interpret the first sentence in the original paragraph 51. Would you please explain exactly what it means.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0132.txt:Today your side brings us the question of the opinions of revision of paragraph 2 and 3 presented by our side. We would like to point out that the opinions on the revision of paragraphs 2 and 3, which our side presented, were presented for consultation and discussion with your side. If your side insists or objects to these opinions on the revisions which our side proposes, thon our side will not insist on it.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0133.txt:If your side has nothing further to present for discussion, we suggest that we recess until eleven o'clock tomorrow morning. He would like to hear your views.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0133.txt:COL DARROW: It seems to me the statements you make are quite contradictory. I stated twenty minutes ago that I would be glad to answer your question and explain our views. You have taken twenty minutes to tell me that I won't answer your question.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0138.txt:COL DARROW: During the negotiations of the staff officers last year, we reached agreement on maps including the lines of communications and the ports of entry. It would seem desirable that both sides bring maps to the next staff officers' meeting in order to check their accuracy and to determine if there are any desirable changes necessary therein.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0139.txt:COL DARROW: We are ready to hear your views concerning paragraphs we proposed yesterday and other now issues, if there are any. Regarding sub-paragraph 13a submitted by your side yesterday, we note that in your wording of paragraph 13a you have included a provision requiring the removal of all demolitions, minefields, wire entanglements and other hazards within thirty (30) days after the termination of the 72-hour period. We agree with you that this operation should be completed as expeditiously as possible. On the other hand, both sides realize that mines and demolitions which have lain in position for long periods of time become extremely sensitive due to deterioration, making their removal a very slow and painstaking operation requiring the use of specially trained demolition personnel. In addition, both sides know that an enormous amount of wire has been laid on the front, the removal of which would be a long: time consuming operation. By requiring that all such hazards removed within thirty (30) days, we are subjecting both sides to the possibility of failure to comply with the agreement because of a possible lack of physical means to implement it. Since this operation will be done as directed by and under the supervision of the Military Armistice Commission, we feel it better not to set a specific time limit, but instead require that the operation be completed as expeditiously as possible. Thus it would be for the Military Armistice Commission to decide within what period of time this operation can and must be completed depending upon the actual conditions. We propose that this sentence, therefore, be changed to road as follows: \"Subsequently additional safe lanes shall be cleared; all hazards\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0140.txt:I would like your opinion on this matter.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0141.txt:In these meetings your side has also expressed an intent similar to ours regarding this question. As to how to write a provision into the Armistice Agreement, I would like to inquire about the views of your side.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0142.txt:We would like to know whether your side has any new opinion regarding paragraph 51.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0142.txt:Regarding sub-paragraph 51b, during the interpreters' meetings, when both sides were revising the Armistice Agreement for the carrot phraseology, it is my understanding that the phrase \"both sides agree\" would not be used in any of the paragraphs inasmuch as it would be unnecessary. I would like to suggest a rephrasing of paragraph 51b submitted by your side. The paragraph should begin with the wording \"all\" and read as follows: \"All those remaining prisoners of war, who are not directly repatriated, shall be released from the military control and from the custody of the detaining side and handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission for disposition in accordance with the provision in Annex *D* hereto, Terms of Reference For Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.\" You will note that the change is technical only in order to conform with other paragraphs in the Armistice Agreement. What are your views regarding this change?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0152.txt:COL JU: We would like to hear your views on paragraph 51 which we presented yesterday.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0153.txt:CAL DARROW: Our side is willing and anxious to reach agreement on the wording of paragraph 51 which is acceptable to both sides. As I stated before, we have made an effort to write the first sentence which accurately reflects the agreement reached by both sides as well as provide wording which should be acceptable to both sides and subject to no misinterpretation of any kind. Our side has proposed that 1 your side insists upon including a summary sentence at the beginning of paragraph 51, that the sentence would read \"All prisoners of war held In the custody of each side at the time this Armistice Agreement becomes effective shall be released and repatriated as soon as possible in conformity with sub-paragraph a below, or shall be released from the control of the detaining side and handed over to the Neutral\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0154.txt:No one can deny that this is an accurate statement, completely summarizing the agreement reached by our two delegations. Our sentence is absolutely clear and subject to no misinterpretation what so ever. Our side cannot understand why there would be any objection by your side to our proposed wording. Our side is willing to make every effort to reach an acceptable agreement on the wording of a first sentence for paragraph 51. Our side is willing to accept the proposal your side made yesterday if it is modified to accurately reflect the agreement reached by our two (2) delegations.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0156.txt:We believe that this time limit will be completely adequate if both sides will make every effort to complete the work of making the Demilitarized Zone actually demilitarized.

Therefore, if both sides use the same basic map, the need for Annex *A*, Annex \"B\", and Annex \"C\" would be eliminated. In this event, our side believes the corrections in paragraph 2 and paragraph 3 are quite simple. Our side suggests that the last sentence of paragraph 2 be deleted. We suggest that the penultimate sentence and the last sentence of paragraph 3 be deleted. We see no other changes that would be necessary. In this event we would have only one (1) Annex in the Armistice Agreement, namely, the Terms of Reference.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0157.txt:In order to facilitate your consideration during lunch, we would like to bring up another question. We have reexamined the provisions in the Armistice Agreement. It is originally provided in paragraph 131: \"Jointly constant, operate, and maintain a suitable airfield at the site of the headquarters of the Military Armistice Commission for such uses as the Commission may determine.\" We recall that for this provision your side originally proposed that your side alone would construct an airfield in the vicinity of the headquarters of the\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0158.txt:COL PU: (CONT’D) Military Armistice Commission. Afterwards, our side proposed, and both sides have agreed, that both sides jointly construct an airfield. Because of technical reasons, we are now prepared to propose that both sides will respectively construct, operate, and maintain a suitable airfield in the Demilitarized Zone in the vicinity of the headquarters of the military Armistice Commission. Their uses will still be determined by the Military Armistice Commission. We would like to know the views of your side on this question.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0158.txt:COL JU: Yesterday we expressed our opinion about paragraph 36 of the Draft Armistice Agreement, and now we would like to hear your views on it.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0158.txt:COL JU: We asked you about the question of the travelling expenses for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission as well as the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. We would like to hear your views on it.\n",

            "Cleaned_data_8/0159.txt:CAL DARROW: I would like to have a mutual discussion on the maps and proposals made by your side, but before taking up the problem on the map, I would like to discuss some other points,\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0159.txt:Once we have reached agreement on the Armistice Terms and the maps, there will be a period of time required to put the documents in order for signature.

            "Cleaned_data_8/0160.txt:As an example of the nature of topics which could be discussed in these preliminary meetings are such items as the construction of facilities at Panmunjom, the nature and type of credentials and distinctive insignia for members of the military Armistice Commission, the arrangements for the first meeting of the military Armistice Commission, and such other matters that would assist in the smooth development of the military Armistice Commission and its functions.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0160.txt:COL DARROW: That is all I have to take up prior to discussing the maps. Is there anything you would like to discuss before we take up the maps?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0160.txt:COL DARROW: As a first order of business for discussing the maps, I would like to suggest that we compare the maps of each side to be sure we are in agreement,\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0160.txt:COL DARROW: The first map I would like to check is that of the Han River Estuary. It is my understanding that the staff groups preparing the Military Demarcation Line have agreed that it has been moved slightly to the East. It is my understanding that this line follows this road (pointing on map) to the point on the map marked \"ferry\". This would require that the Han River Estuary be moved up river to the point where the military Demarcation Line intersects the Imjin River. This would require changing our maps to reflect this change in the military Demarcation Line, as I have indicated here. Do you have any changes other than I have suggested?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0160.txt:COL DARROW: I would like to compare each map concerning the ports of entry to be certain that both sides are in agreement.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0161.txt:COL DARROW: Yes, that was our idea. However, if we can reach an agreement today on exactly where these boundary lines should be, we could initiate action to prepare the maps in final form. However, if your side would like to take this book of maps of our side and study it carefully, drawing in changes which you believe are necessary and then meet tomorrow, we can agree.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0162.txt:We find no difference of opinion in the legend of map 4. In connection with the descriptions included for maps of ports of entry, we are not certain whether it is necessary to include the descriptions. If we do include descriptions, I believe it will be necessary to add the phrase \"and remove from” between the words \"into” and “Korea\". This would be in accordance with our recent agreement on sub-paragraphs 13c and d. I will leave for your consideration the desirability of omitting or including the descriptions on the maps of the ports of entry. Also, it may be desirable to refer to paragraph 13 as well as paragraph 43.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0162.txt:Our side considers it desirable, as we have already agreed, for each side to prepare a set of maps for inclusion in the Armistice Agreement other than that which is being set up as a common map for the Military Demarcation Line and the Demilitarized Zone. As a matter of practicality, I do not believe it is necessary to prepare three (3) sets of maps. That is, one (1) for the English version, another for the Korean version, and a third for the Chinese version. What I am suggesting is that we print on each pep the legends and such other overprinting as necessary in all three (3) languages. In other words, on this map we would have the English, the Korean, and the Chinese on the same map. In other words, this same map would be attached to the English, Korean, and Chinese versions of the Armistice Agreement. Your side could do the same thing with the maps that you prepare.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0163.txt:COL JU: In order that the preparation work would not affect the time of signing, we propose that no change will be made insofar as possible to the maps already prepared. We agree that if the words “and removed from” are added to the description on each map of the parts of entry in accordance with the revisions which both sides have made to paragraph 13c, then each such pep will be more complete. However, we believe that even though no changes are made, there will be no misunderstanding therefrom. Therefore, we would still like to propose that no change will be made to the descriptions already decided upon. We would like to inquire of your views in this connection,\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0163.txt:In some of the maps which we have already prepared, it is comparatively easy to add the English words, whereas in other maps it is comparatively difficult. We would like to exchange opinions with your side on this point. For example, on the pop of the port of entry of Sinanju, it is rather difficult to add the English words. Does your side have any suggestion on this point?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0164.txt:COL DARROW: As long as your side would like to retain the descriptions, our side can agree to it.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0164.txt:It is my understanding that our side would retain a signed copy of the maps and armistice document prepared by your side, and that our side would prepare two sets of agreements which will be signed and kept by your side. Is that your understanding? That is, of course, in addition to the maps each side prepares which are signed and kept by each side.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0164.txt:Mr. Underwood has corrected me. I left out those maps that go to the Military Armistice Commission. The point I'm making is that our side retains a signed copy of the agreement that your side prom pares. And on that copy that you prepare in English, we would like to have the legend in English. We also believe that those copies you prepare in English for the Military Armistice Commission and any extra copies prepared by you and delivered to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission-those which you prepare in English-should have English legends on the maps. The problem you raise regarding this map I recognize. Perhaps on the English version you could delete either one of the Chinese or Korean legends, or both.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0164.txt:As to your views regarding the legend on the maps of English copies prepared by our side, we will continue to consider it. Our preliminary views are that the Korean and Chinese descriptions on such maps would not be dispensed with. The English descriptions can be put at a place which will not affect the substance of the map.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0166.txt:COL DARROW: Yesterday our side said we would submit a proposed wording for sub paragraph 13i. Our side has also prepared the title for the Annex, Terms of Reference. In commenting on paragraph 51a, our side had proposed certain technical revisions in the wording which would bring this paragraph in consonance with the arrangements made for writing all paragraphs in the Armistice Agreement.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0166.txt:COL DARROW: We would like to know whether your side has any further opinion on paragraph 51, Yesterday our side had suggested there (3) alternate solutions to paragraph 51.

There is no reason why both sides cannot agree on the proposal I made yesterday, which is an accurate statement of the agreement reached by our two\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0167.txt:COL PU: We would like to make clear once again the position of our side on this question. We consider that actually there is no justification whatsoever to make any change to the original first sentence in the Armistice Agreement. In view of the insistence of your side, we have, for the purpose of reaching agreement speedily, proposed a revised provision which allows no further dispute.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0168.txt:COL JU: Before beginning, we would like to hear your views on the Index we handed you yesterday.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0168.txt:COL PU: As to the question of who is going to authenticate, our opinion is that we shall adopt the same formal method of binding in the case of the copies of the maps, as in the case of the Agreement. In other words, all the naps will be bound by silk ribbon into a book, and on it we will put scaling wax. If such a formal method of binding is adopted, then it is act necessary to sign on each sot of maps. We can still adopt the method of signing the Index which appears on the first page. We would like to know your views on this method.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0168.txt:COL DARROW: I note your views, and I shall investigate the possibility of adopting your method of formal binding. If we find that this can be done, then our side would agree to the authentication as proposed by you. I assure that your side would not object to any formal method\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0169.txt:COL DARROW: (CONT’D) of binding, provide: it would be secure and properly scaled. That is, binding which might be sewn as in a book.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0170.txt:COL JU: Our view on the batter is that we would leave the line where it is drawn. Of course, at the time of high tide, shallow draft boats can traverse it, but if we draw the line for the government of ships, we exclude the YOK KU-DO.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0172.txt:We compared the parts of entry maps and find that the differences are so slight that due to the map making process such errors are likely to creep in even though we attempt to copy exactly each others lines. Even though we attempted to change cur printing plates, I believe we would find small discrepancies with a new edition of the map, caused by slight variations in the scale and the shrinkage or expansion of the map paper.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0173.txt:COL JU: This morning we proposed to your Senior Liaison Officer, through our Security officer, that the officers meet one (1) hour after this Staff Officers' Meeting. I would like to hear the opinion of Colonel Darrow.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0174.txt:COL JU: (CONT’D) questions to be solved at the Staff Officers' Meeting this afternoon, I hope that we will continue to meet and that you will present them at present. If not, we would like to have a longer recess, I would like to hear your views.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0175.txt:As to the wording of paragraphs 51a and b, we think that it is not difficult to reach agreement on then after we have settled on the main statement of paragraph 51. This morning I suggested a proposed revision of paragraph 51 that your side had most recently proposed. How would you like this statement I have suggested to be changed so that it would be acceptable to your side? In order to save time, and as I believe Colonel Ju Yon would go to our Liaison Officers' Meeting after this meeting, I will frankly state the position of our side.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0175.txt:I ask you how you would like to phrase the sentence I proposed this morning so that it would be acceptable to you. Unless you are willing to indicate what is acceptable, I will find it difficult to\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0176.txt:COL PU: As we have already pointed out, regarding the main statement of paragraph 51, what would be possible for us to accept is either that the original sentence in the Draft Armistice Agreement not be changed or that the revised provision proposed by us recently will not be changed. In order to reach agreement speedily, we proposed that the main statement of paragraph 51, which our side recently proposed, will be adopted without any change. In so doing we can speedily enter into discussion of and settle on the wording of sub-paragraphs 51a and b.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0176.txt:Your side seems unable to offer suggestions. Perhaps I can make some suggestions which would be acceptable to your side. For some reason unknown to our side you do not desire to use the word “disposition\" in the main statement of paragraph 52, although you have recommended its use in sub-paragraph 51b. I now propose that the words \"or disposition\" be deleted from the sentence recommended by our side this morning. You will find that I now have the exact wording proposed by your side with the exception of a technical change in the last part of the sentence.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0176.txt:The statement, I believe, now is exactly as you would like it, except I have changed it to read more in conformity with the rest of the paragraphs in the armistice document. This last proposal of our side should eliminate any of the differences between our two (2) sides on the entire paragraph 51, including a, b, and c.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0177.txt:COL PU: Our revised provision for paragraph 51 itself has adopted the views of both sizes. Originally we had hoped that both sides can reach agreement on the revised provision proposed by us without any further arguments, so as to immediately enter into the discussion of paragraphs 5la and b. If your side insists, we would agree to continue the discussion on the min statement of paragraph 51. However, our side is not prepared to make further concessions on this question, as we have already made the greatest possible concession on it.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0177.txt:COL DARROW: Then I assume we are in agreement on this paragraph, but would you check to see if this technical change is suitable?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0177.txt:COL PU: Since your side insists on continuing the discussion of this question, we would like to point out that the change which your side proposed to take the revised provision of our side is entirely unnecessary end it is repetitious with the provision in this paragraph.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0177.txt:Your side has also proposed that you would like to revise the preface which your side considers repetitious in paragraph 51c, proposed by our side. If both sides reach agreement on the main statement of paragraph 51, our side will be prepared to consider the views of your side.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0178.txt:In order that both sides can initiate action to prepare the armistice document for signing, I believe it would be a good idea if our two sides would run through the document quickly to determine which paragraphs we are in agreement on, and those yet to be agreed upon.\n",

            "Cleaned_data_8/0180.txt:COL DARROW: I think we can continue on, and, as you say, the resolution of paragraph 36 might possibly affect some of the paragraphs following. However, I do not see that there would be any major change, if any at all.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0181.txt:COL PU: (CONT’D) paragraph 37 or paragraph 42. We have inquired of your opinion in this connection. Before this question is decided upon, we would like to reserve the right to revise paragraphs 36 through paragraph 50. But for this question, we agree with your opinion that no change is needed in paragraphs 36 to paragraph 50. As to paragraph 51, our understanding is that both sides have not reached agreement.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0184.txt:As to the matter of authentication, our side is suggesting that rather than have it authenticated on the index page, that this page, the first page in the book, be used as the title page which would be \"Armistice Agreement, Volume 2, Maps\" as both sides have agreed upon, and then the authentication at the lower portion of this title page.\n",

What our side would like to do is to compile o single book of raps which would be applicable for all three (3) language versions of the text of the Armistice Agreement. In other words, this pap volume would be complete in English, in Korean, and in Chinese. That would mean the index page would contain the index in three (3) languages side by side; the authentication in three (3) languages side by side. Similarly the title. We suggest this since it will save a great deal of time in preparing our maps for signature.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0186.txt:COL DARROW: One point I would like to have agreed upon. We propose in putting on the three languages on each map, to put Korean on the left, English in the center, and Chinese on the right. Is that agreeable with your side?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0187.txt:COL DARROW: Our side considers the entire sentence unnecessary. In regard to your proposal, why do you think it is necessary to add the obvious phrase, \"agreed upon by both sides prior to the signing of this Armistice Agreement\"? I believe to save time and core difficulty in this matter, we could use your sentence and end it after the word \"provisions,\" I am not objecting to your sentence as far as substance. I would like to see us prepare the armistice document in good form.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0187.txt:COL PU: In our proposed revisions, your side can see that we maintain that the least change will be made to the various provisions which both sides have already agreed upon. Our original proposal is that paragraph 51 in one Draft Armistice Agreement would be retained without making any change to it and only to change the words \"lists which have been exchanged and have been checked\" into the following provision agreed upon,\" so as to be in conformity with the current agreement between both sides.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0188.txt:COL DARROW: (CONT'D) has any basis for implementation of the prisoner of war proposal which our two (2) sides were discussing last year? Is it your intention that all prisoners of war will be released and repatriated as soon as possible? Do you further expect our side to take the action contemplated when we agreed upon paragraph 51; that is, to release from prisoners of war status to civilian status those prisoners to forcibly resist repatriation and that their names would not be on the lists submitted for exchange?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0189.txt:We entirely agree that in accordance with the manner for concrete implementation with the question of prisoners of war agreed upon by both sides, your side cannot adopt a unilateral method of so-called release of prisoners of war which is in entirety forcible retention of prisoners of war. For the manner of concrete implementation of the question of prisoners of war agreed upon by both sides recently, it is impossible to have any different understanding. We have clearly stated this point every time when we presented the revised provisions to paragraph 51. In our revised provisions for paragraph 51, we have explicitly stipulated that the manner for concrete implementation for the question of prisoners of war shall be in accordance with that agreed upon by both sides recently. In other words it should be in conformity with paragraphs 51a and b. It would not only include the Terms of Reference for the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission agreed upon by both sides, but also to include the Preamble which both sides have agreed upon.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0189.txt:COL DARROW: I would like your side to consider during the recess the elimination of a first sentence which in turn would eliminate all differences of opinion as to the meaning of your words that you have proposed.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0191.txt:COL PU: (CONTD) enjoy immunity. I would like to know whether your side has the same understanding on this point.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0192.txt:COL DARROW: As I understand your statement, you consider that the second sentence, relating to extraterritoriality, could be deleted. If this turns out to be the case, perhaps a more suitable location in the armistice document for the remainder of this provision would be a sub-paragraph under paragraph 13. This would be sub-paragraph 13j.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0193.txt:COL PU: We have been consistently of the opinion that both sides reached complete agreement as to the manner for concrete implementation in solving the prisoner of war question at the time both sides reached complete agreement recently on the prisoner of war question and signed the agreement concerning it on 8 June. In these Staff officers' meetings, we have repeatedly pointed out this fact. We did not expect that it would take until today to make your side realize that both sides have reached complete agreement on the manner for concrete implementation in solving the prisoner of war question. However, in any case, both sides have now reached agreement on the main statement of paragraph 51. This is worthy of celebration.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0193.txt:We have already agreed to change the words \"two months\" in the first sentence of paragraph 51a, originally proposed by our side, to “60 days\". In your proposed wording you have changed the words \"all those prisoners of war in its custody who insist on repatriation\" into \"all those prisoners of war who insist upon repatriation.\" We consider that the original wording proposed by our side is more explicit. But if your side insists on making such a change, we would not object to it.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0194.txt:In paragraph 51b your side proposed to eliminate the words \"both sides agree\". We can agree to eliminate the words \"agree to\" and substitute \"shall\". We would like to know the opinion of your side.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0194.txt:COL DARROW: In regard to the phrase \"in its custody our side has no objection to including it if you wish. Our side feels that the phrase \"without offering any hindrance is an implication that the commanders have intent to do otherwise. We feel that such a phrase could be added in many paragraphs of this agreement. As an example, 13f, which states it would \"permit graves registration people to enter,\" then add \"without offering any hindrance.\" In other words, such a phrase casts reflection upon our commanders, and, therefore, we believe it to be inappropriate to place in an armistice document of this nature.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0196.txt:COL DARROW: It might require some rewording in that case. We could change it to read: \"Each side shall release all those remaining prisoners of war who are not directly repatriated from its military control and its custody and hand then over,\" with the remaining part of the sentence the same. This would be in accordar.co with our practice of preparing the armistice document throughout.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0196.txt:COL PU: We believe that if we have to make a choice, then we would prefer to adopt your previous proposal and not the last one. We will study this question and give you an answer tomorrow.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0197.txt:COL DARROW: I agree. There is no doubt that both sides are in agreement in paragraph 51. It is just a matter of how we put the words together. Our side would like to have paragraph 51b written in accordance with the Preamble.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0197.txt:COL DARROW: What time would be proper to meet tomorrow morning? \\\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0197.txt:COL JU: I would like to meet again at eleven o'clock tomorrow morning. You can inform Colonel Carlock that he should be in the Liaison Officers’ meeting at six o'clock.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0200.txt:COL DARROW: We believe the sentence would read a little better without it. There is no difference in substance, and, as I understand, it is not included in to Korean version. We would prefer that it be omitted, without the use of the word, our side considers that\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0201.txt:COL PU: We consider that it will be more explicit in stating in this item that the members and other personnel of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission shall all enjoy freedom and facilities necessary. Since your side considers that such wording does not read so smooth in English, our side can also consider the wording in your statement of a moment ago and change the wording into \"insured that all members and other personnel -\". I would like to know your opinion.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0202.txt:Our side would prefer paragraph 51b to read exactly as written in the Preamble. However, I think we can complete our work today by the acceptance of paragraph 51b that you have submitted this morning and your acceptance of adding the word \"proper.” in paragraph 13j.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0202.txt:We would like to know whether the understanding of ours is correct.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0208.txt:COL CAIRNS: As soon as Colonel Murray finishes with his present meeting, we would like to meet with you on arrangements for the signing and other matters, Col Ju, I propose that the staff Officers recess until the interpreters finish with their work.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0209.txt:We would like to know your opinion on this question.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0209.txt:COL PU: In the signature block of the Terms of Reference of the Chinese version we propose to change the present title of the Senior Delegate of our side into \"Chao hsien jen-min Chun Ta-Chiang” to be consistent with the signature block of the entire Agreement. I would like to know your opinion on this question.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0209.txt:COL CAIRNS: As I remember, it was agreed that there would be no change whatsoever in the terms of reference, because it was signed an 8 June 1953 by the Senior Delegates as a complete agreement. Any change in this agreement now would be improper.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0210.txt:COL PU: With regard to the two (2) questions raised by your side, firstly, as to the place of the title of the Supreme Commander of our side in the signature block of the agreement of the Korean and Chinese versions: In view of the usage of the Korean and Chinese languages, we consider that the form adopted by our side now is acre proper. We would like to know your opinion on this question also.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0210.txt:COL CAIRNS: As I understand it, you want to put the words “Marshal, Democratic People's Republic of Korea” all on one line. As you can see from this Chinese version of the Agreement, to put all these words on one line would crowd the signature block. Therefore, we believe It is better to use two (2) lines for these words. Inasmuch as it is a matter of form only, we can see no objection to using two (2) lines.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0210.txt:COL PU: We still hope that your side will give consideration simultaneously to our two proposals of these questions. However, if your side actually feels great difficulty in reprinting, then we would also consider that as to the questions of the putting of the title all on one line, your side can use the form which your site uses now, and our side will use our present form.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0211.txt:COL PU: (CONT’D) We would like to know whether there is any particular difficulty for your side to dispense with this title page in your version.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0211.txt:COL PU: As to Sub-paragraph 59a of the English version, our understanding is that the version we prepared is now completely the same as the previous agreement between both sides. We understand that at the interpreters meeting, your side proposed to add one word in this sub-paragraph. As your side is doing it now, we would also like to know If there is any particular difficulty for your side to dispense with this word in your version?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0211.txt:COL PU: We have only one more question which we would like to raise today.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0211.txt:In the way of binding of the texts prepared by our side, both sides have to seal them. We understand that your side might not use the same binding method as ours. But we would like to know whether your side has made preparations to seal the texts of our side.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0213.txt:I suggest that the interpreters meet after this meeting to cover each one of the points in detail. We have also rechecked the Korean version of the Draft Armistice Agreement and find no major errors. On the subject of seals, we would like to have a full explanation from you as to just exactly how you propose to make use of the seals and the silk ribbon.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0214.txt:COL CAIRNS: Before answering that question I would like to ask a few more questions about your ideas on this whole subject. It is your idea that the seals of both sides be placed on all eighteen (18) copies of the text and on all eighteen (18) copies of the maps? If so, when would the seals be emplaced on these copies? And another question, does the sketch here (Col Cairns points to circle on paper a little larger than a silver dollar) show the approximate size of your seal? We have no further questions at this time.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0214.txt:COL PU: We are prepared to adopt your way of binding in the copies we prepare. As to the copies your side prepares, as you feel that it is difficult to bind in this way, we do not insist that you adopt this same method that is to say to deny the copies prepared by our side will be scaled. As to the time for sealing we contemplate that it would take place after sides finally checked the copies of text and maps prepared by both sides and before the formal signing ceremony. The size of the seals we prepared is four (4) centimeters in diameter. The size is similar to that we draw on the sketch.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0215.txt:As to your statements concerning the Terms of Reference a moment ago, our understanding is that you mean that its contents will not be changed and it will be included in the Armistice Agreement. As to our opinions of yesterday concerning the signing block of Terms of Reference, it is not included in this group mentioned in your statement. We would like to know whether such an understanding is correct.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0215.txt:As to the questions of exchanging the galley proofs of the attached taps which your side raised both sides have agreed at the previous Staff Officers' Meetings that the English on attached maps prepared by our side will not be printed in press but would be\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0216.txt:We agree that the interpreters today should discuss any discrepancies on technical differences found in our maps. We would like to complete this final checking today so that we may start the printing of these maps.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0216.txt:With regard to the question concerning the effective date of all Paragraphs of the Armistice Agreement in Paragraph 12 and the date for signing the Armistice Agreement we would estimate that according to the actual conditions of communications in our area, the persons of the neutral nations nominated by both sides will be able to arrive at their respective, specific ports of entry and begin to exercise their functions seven (7) days after the affective date of the cease-fire. Therefore, we propose that all paragraphs of the Armistice Agreement that are in Paragraph 12 which has different provisions will begin to be effective seven and one\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0217.txt:We still consider that the date for the signing of the Armistice Agreement will not be substantially different from your estimation made at the previous Plenary Session. We would like to know your views on this question.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0218.txt:COL CARLOCK: As a beginning, I would like to suggest some of the administrative details upon which we feel a mutual understanding will be required in order to facilitate the repatriation operations.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0223.txt:Because the construction of the reception site might delay the restriction operations, I would like your views on our proposal that officers go immediately to select the reception sites.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0225.txt:It is precisely for security, and to prevent congestion, that we suggested separation of the two areas. Can you explain in more detail how the placing of the two areas together would facilitate the operation?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0225.txt:COL LEE: I suspend discussing this matter. I would like to explain the opinion of our side on other matters. It is your conception that the rosters should be written with names of the personnel being repatriated in their own language. It is our opinion that the names of personnel being repatriated should be written in the Korean, Chinese and English languages respectively. In other words, it means that the names of the Korean sick and injured prisoners on the rosters should be written in the Korean language; the names of the Chinese sick and injured prisoners on the rosters should be in Chinese; and the names of the sick and injured personnel with other nationalities should be in English.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0226.txt:COL CARLOCK: I do not anticipate any disagreement. However, I will give you a final answer later. I would like to speak further.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0227.txt:COL LEE: If your side has no more to state, Colonel Wang Chien of our side would like to make a statement.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0228.txt:COL CARLOCK: We would like three signed copies for administrative reasons\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0228.txt:Our side feels that there would not be any great difficulty in doing that. However, we understand that if both sides signed three copies of rosters, then the signed copies should be kept by both sides, respectively. Therefore, we consider that it seems to be adequate to sign two copies and each side retain one of them, respectively. I would like to hear your opinion.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0232.txt:For this reason, we should like to offer another alternative for your consideration. We feel that the high ground across the road from this conference building is sufficiently large in area so that it would be possible to construct a bypass road which would remove traffic a considerable distance from this conference building, and that this area is also large enough that it could accommodate the receiving areas of both sides.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0233.txt:reception area selected by your side is too close to the conference site area tent. The reason your side does not accept our side's offer is the only one thing that is causing difficulty to constructing of roads. I think this question would easily be solved if both sides express a positive attitude. I should like to emphasize again that it is of significance that there should be some distance between the reception areas of both sides and the conference site.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0233.txt:COL CARLOCK: I still disagree that the sites proposed by our side would cause complications because of proximity to the conference building. Our intention was to build a by-pass road well away from the conference site building. However, I intend not to discuss this question any further at this time,\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0235.txt:COL CARLOCK (CONT'D): typewritten English copy will reflect those changes. Does your side have any further suggestions for changes in the administrative details? If so, I would suggest that they be taken up at some subsequent meeting.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0237.txt:COL CARLOCK: I think it would be advantageous if we agree on the found as to the exact location of the sites, and then there can be no room for misunderstanding by reason of selection from a rep or sketch. Before proceeding to inspect the areas, I request to know the location on the map of the area you will select for your reception.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0238.txt:COL LEE: Agreeing to your statement that the engineers of your side would commence the preparation work from tomorrow, this side believes that they will be able to contact the Security Officers of both sides to proceed with their work, our side will also commence the preparation work from tomorrow within the area selected by our side.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0238.txt:Within the area selected by our side there is a balloon set up by your side. This side would like to know whether your side could remove it or not.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0238.txt:COL WANG: For the sake of convenience for future work, I would like to raise a few questions regarding the roster submitted by your side. Are you going to use two or three languages for the items listed in the rosters? For the item of rank, are you going to use two languages, that is Korean and English, or Chinese and English? To the receipt on the back of the roster, are you going to use three languages for all these items? As to the date, are you going to use three languages also? And for the signature, is it to be in the nationality of the receipting officers? Please give an explanation for the item \"representative or organization\".\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0243.txt:COL WANG: In the receipt there is the column naming the representatives, in parenthesis, “which organization” --we would like you to clarify this point. Does it mean the Duty Officer or the Receipting Officer?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0246.txt:COL CAIRNS: I would like to amend that last statement. This counter-proposal pertains only to the marking of vehicles.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0247.txt:COL CAIRNS: Past experience has shown that the markings you propose for your vehicles do not afforded the degree visibility required for maxima security. We wish you would re-study our proposal carefully and give us your answer later.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0247.txt:COL WANG: Starting from today, the engineering personnel of both sides have already begun the construction of its own reception area. For the convenience of work with regard to the question of construction of roads, I would like to make a further explanation according to the Understanding presented by our site to your side total. Our view is that our side is responsible for all the construction of all of the roads into our reception area for entry or exit of vehicles of both sides. Likewise, your side is responsible for the construction of all the roads into your reception area for entry or exit c. the vehicles for both sides.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0254.txt:COL CARLOCK: I would like to request that we have this statement in writing and, further, that you furnish geographical coordinates of the locations, and, if possible, maps showing then.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0254.txt:It would be agreeable to our side if you delivered the matters that we requested through security officers.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0255.txt:I wish to inform your side of our tentative plan for delivery of sick and injured captured personnel which our side holds. This plan is to deliver to your reception area from one to four groups of 25 persons each at one time. We would like to know if your reception plan will fit this plan of delivery.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0255.txt:I note that the first convoy carrying United Nations Command sick and injured captured personnel in the custody of your side will arrive in KAESONG on 16 April, I would like to urge that your side consider delivering these personnel before 20 April. We are prepared to commence the repatriation deliveries of sick and injured personnel of your side on any data that you are ready to start the operation.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0260.txt:3. You stated that your stop-overs would be identified by red cloths A motors long and 80 centimeters wide. Can you tell me exactly how you intend to place those markers?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0261.txt:COL CAIRNS: Before we recess I have two (2) other statements I would like to make. Maybe you can consider these two (2) statements at the same time.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0261.txt:I would also like to know if you have the break-down by nationality of the 15 sick and injured captured personnel of our side those nationalities you have not furnished our side as yet.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0262.txt:COL LEE: I will answer the questions raised by your side. First, regarding the question on how each vehicle of the convoy would be identified, we intend to cover the top of the hood of each vehicle with a red cloth of one square meter and place at the beck of each vehicle a flag pole, hosting a flag made of red cloth of one square meter. Second, as to the markings of night stopovers, we intend to make red crosses of two pieces of red cloth four meters in length and eighty centimeters in width, which will be placed in proper position in the night stop-over areas shown on the map furnished to your side. We will concentrate sick and injured captured personnel and vehicles as close as possible to the points identified by the red crosses. Third, as to the question of markings the night stop-overs, in view of actual conditions, our side will not use other markings except for the markings which have already been furnished to your side. This question was discussed in January 1952 when the question of markings of prisoner of war camps was dealt with in the course of the Stall Officers' Meetings of both sides.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0263.txt:Now I hand you a sample roster (See Encl 1) prepared by our side. At the same time I would like to make the following explanation:\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0267.txt:COL CAIRNS: I have another question about your stop-over markings. In order that there be no misunderstanding about your stop-over markings for your convoys, I would like to know more definitely how you are planning on marking your day time stop-overs. That is, will you place any markers in the area, and if so, how many will there be and how will they be placed?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0268.txt:COL CAIRNS: I understand the answer you have given me concerning the motor convey. When you first furnished us with the information of your markings, we understood you to say that they would be pieces of red cloth four (4) meters long, and eighty (80) centimeters wide. Yesterday you said that these pieces of red cloth would be placed in the form of a red cross. My question now is, will these markings always be in the form of a red cross?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0273.txt:COL CAIRNS: I have a statement to make. On 11 April we informed you that on the first day of repatriation we planned to repatriate to you approximately 100 Chinese and 400 Korean sick and Injured captured personnel, and asked if you were also intending to repatriate proportionate numbers by nationality, on the same day. You replied that it would depend on the actual situation. Are you now in a position to tell us whether you are able to repatriate proportionate cumbers, by nationality, on the first day?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0277.txt:Our side would like to know when your side will be ready to hold the meeting of Liaison Groups so as to discuss and decide the date for resuming negotiations between the delegates to the armistice negotiations.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0279.txt:With regard to the establishment of delivery teams' control points and traffic control posts proposed by your side yesterday, our side has no objection. Our side would also establish delivery teams' control points in the neighborhood or your reception area, and when necessary, also, traffic control posts at the intersection of the main thoroughfare in the Conference Site Area and the entrance of your reception area.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0279.txt:COL CAIRNS: I want to make sure that I understand you correctly. Did you say that you would also establish traffic control posts at these two points? (Discussion over map follows)\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0285.txt:We intend to set up a termination of travel control site in this area. (Points to the area.) The equipment would be a tent.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0291.txt:COL WANG: Our side agrees to the limits of the reception area of your side as defined on this map. I wish that your side would also deliver to our side a map which shows the limits of your reception area.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0297.txt:We have preliminary studied your proposals, and they appear reasonable. However, we would like to make a more thorough study before definitely agreeing to them.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0300.txt:As Admiral Daniel has stated in his letter to General Lee, we would much prefer to receive our personnel in a steady now and therefore request that you deliver by groups at half-hour intervals starting at 0900 hours.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0300.txt:In regard to the schedule you propose for our deliveries to you, there are two minor changes we recommend: We would like to deliver your personnel two (2) groups at a time. Therefore, we suggest that the schedule be two (2) groups at 0900 hours, two (2) groups at 0920 hours, two (2) groups at 1000 hours, two (2) groups at 1020 hours, and so forth. We also feel that the break during the middle of the day is unnecessarily long, and therefore we propose only a one-hour interval during the\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0301.txt:Of course, it is our conception that this schedule would be adjustable more or less as to actual situations.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0302.txt:COL LEE: We would like to know whether or not your side could inform our side of the breakdown of the sick and injured captured personnel whom your side will repatriate to our side on the first day, and the number of litter cases.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0306.txt:COL JU: I would say that we agree to having the wording as it is in paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and the first part of 8. You say that you agree to letting the wording of it stay as it is, and I also agree to your idea. But in the interest of speedily carrying on the discussions, we propose that the minor changes of the wording for the interpreters is no great matter, so they should be discussed right at this table.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0308.txt:I would like to add another phrase, too, in order that the Commission or one of its subordinate bodies would validate the application that was our intention, it would read, \"By the Commission or one of its subordinate bodies.\"\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0308.txt:The insertion of the additional phrase \"By the Commission or one of its subordinate bodies\" would clarify this point.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0309.txt:COL DARROW: The second sentence now provides that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission will determine the validity of the application. The third sentence says once the application is validated the prisoners will be repatriated. \"Validation\" used in the third sentence does not necessarily apply to the determination of the validity of the application as used in the second sentence unless it were indicated by what body it was done. Both sides are in agreement as to the intent of this paragraph. It is my opinion that the second sentence which you revised first with the addition of the phrase we propose in the third sentence would make the document more legally correct.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0309.txt:By the use of our proposal there would be no doubt that the body that determines the validity also validates the application.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0309.txt:If your side has no further opinion on paragraph 10, we would like to present our views on paragraph 11.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0309.txt:COL PU: In order that no difficulty will arise when the interpreters of both sides check the three languages, we would like to present some revisions in the English translation of our original texts of paragraph 11.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0310.txt:COL DARROW: We shall take your suggestion under consideration. I would like to continue on unless you have some other point regarding this paragraph.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0311.txt:\"release\" is more proper than the word \"relief\", our side would not like to change this particular word. We have no objection to substituting the word \"choose\" for \"elect\".\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0311.txt:COL DARROW: Our site could agree on the word \"transfer\" in lieu of the word \"release\". However, I believe the use of this word would require a change in the Korean and Chinese version, and our side would prefer\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0312.txt:COL PU: After our study we discovered that the English word you propose would not affect the Korean and Chinese versions. Therefore, we can agree to the English word you propose.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0312.txt:COL DARROW: If we use the word \"transfer\", it is my understanding that the proper translation into Chinese and Korean would not be the same as exists for the word \"release\". Therefore, to have a proper translation from the English to the Korean and Chinese we would have to change the Chinese and Korean versions.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0312.txt:COL PU: Since your side thinks that the use of the English word you proposed would affect the Korean and Chinese versions, our side can consider to make necessary revisions in the Korean and Chinese versions. We propose that this question be referred to the interpreters and be determined by them when they check the three texts.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0318.txt:Regarding paragraph 11, it was my understanding that we would leave the sentence construction as originally proposed by your side without change end to leave blank the space where the words \"release\" and \"released\" were located in the paragraph.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0319.txt:Before we recess, is there anything else you would like to bring up in the staff meeting?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0319.txt:My proposal for recess is the.t the interpreters would return in fifteen minutes to check the parts of the documents that are already agreed upon.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0319.txt:Before the recess, we would like to know what the views of your side are as to the time of signing the agreement.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0320.txt:COL DARROW: Yes, that was the view I expressed which our side feels would be a normal way of handling this matter. Presumably, the Delegations would agree to release the agreed Terms of Reference after signature We have noted the opinion of your side. We propose that the time for signature will be decided upon, based on the conditions for the preparation of the text.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0321.txt:COL DARROW: I will convey your message to my Senior Delegate and this matter can be discussed during the plenary sessions. The interpreters have completed their work and I understand that the documents are ready for signature. As a matter of procedure, I suggest, if your side concurs, that we write in the time and date of signing prior to the meeting of the plenary sessions. As a suggestion, the time would be 1400 hours on the 8th day of June. What are your views on this matter?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0325.txt:The result of attempting to reach agreement on the basis of both of these maps was that the major portion of the time was spent in attempting to reconcile the lines on the two maps and in the accompanying verbal description. The resulting lines and verbal descriptions were not entirely satisfactory, and we have noted numerous inconsistencies. Since the renegotiation of the Demarcation Line is the only substantial task remaining, our side feels that we should make every effort to complete the task quickly, so that the armistice can come into effect. To this end we believe that both sides should agree to the use of a common map to express the official Demarcation Line. This would save the time which we would otherwise have to spend in attempting to reconcile the lines drawn on two maps and the accompanying verbal descriptions. Each side could, following an Armistice Agreement, convert the agreed line from the official map to its own battle caps, and this could be done without delaying the armistice.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0327.txt:Now, as to your suggestion as to a method of proceeding is determining the line which reflects the current combat situation, we believe that it would facilitate matters if we accept the current Demarcation Line as a basis for negotiation. There are portions of it in which no changes may be required. By accepting it, we can reduce our study to those sections of the line where one side or the other considers that the current combat situation requires a change in the line. In order to identify the sections of the line where changes appear to be desirable, we propose that each side indicate those areas in which they consider an advance of the contact line over the previously agreed line is justified.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0328.txt:That is, your side would present to us a map showing proposed changes to the south of the previously agreed Demarcation Line which you feel are justified by advances of your troops since that line was negotiated.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0328.txt:Our side, for its part, would simultaneously present you with a map showing any changes to the north of the Demarcation Line which we consider to be justified by the position of our troops. Once these areas have been identified, we can proceed to consider the merits of the claims made by the side which proposes an advance beyond the original Demarcation Line. In case differences of opinion as to the positions of troops in any one of these areas develops, we can, if necessary, arrange to inspect the positions on the sound. We feel that this method of proceeding would be preferable to discarding the agreed line of contact and starting all over again, as appears to be implied by your method of proceeding. Should you be prepared to concur in proceeding according to this method, we could exchange maps following a recess for lunch.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0329.txt:COL MURRAY: I concur in the sentiments you have expressed; however the effect of your proposal is to throw out the previously agreed line of contact completely. Thus, in place of renegotiating the line of contact, we would be starting from zero to negotiate a new line of contact.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0329.txt:Under the United Nations Command proposal, we would be starting with a firm basis, and the areas to be discussed would be limited to those where one side or the other considers that changes in the positions of troops justifies a change in the line.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0330.txt:I have listened carefully to your reading of the agreement of November 1951. It states that the line then agreed will be renegotiated, and that the revised line will reflect the combat situation existing at the time the armistice is signed. Thus the sense of the agreement is clearly that the previously agreed line would be taken as the basis for the renegotiated or revised line. Our effort has been directed toward identifying and isolating those sections in which revisions are considered necessary.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0330.txt:There is another way of approaching the problem. That is, we can determine that portion of the line of the previously agreed line on which both sides are now willing to agree. If this method would be preferable, I propose that following a recess for lunch, each side submit a map showing that portion of the previously agreed Demarcation Line which it is willing to accept at the present time.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0330.txt:By this means, both sides can appraise themselves of the remaining problems. Naturally, we would proceed more rapidly under the initial proposal made by the United Nations Command to present any proposed changes to the north and south of the original Demarcation Line. But we would proceed less rapidly if we followed your proposal and each submitted a new proposed Demarcation Line.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0331.txt:COL MURRAY: It is true that your proposal would do all that you say that it would do. However, it is not a method for revising the previously agreed line; it is a method for negotiating a completely new line. Any coincidence between the new line and the previously agreed line would be accidental, and every portion of the line would be subject to discussion and debate. Agreement on this line was too difficult to reach in the first instance to discard it completely and start over.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0331.txt:COL HUANG: Before recessing, I would like to express we hope that your side will consider our proposed method of checking the line of contact,\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0332.txt:Our side would like to state that your handing this kind of map to us does not see that we have agreed to your proposed method of checking the line of contact so as to fix the Military Demarcation Line.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0334.txt:I now would like to hear your comments on our proposed revision to the south of the original Demarcation Line, Where the revisions in the Demarcation Line recommended by your side are consistent with the information which is available to our side, We have tentatively accepted them.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0335.txt:If your side has no other opinions now, I would like to explain on the maps those lines which can be determined now. I agree with your proposal.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0336.txt:which would eventually be reached.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0336.txt:With reference to those portions of the actual line of contact which our side presents and to which your side would not agree, we hope that your side will reconsider then in accordance with the actual situation. With reference to your proposed revision to the north of the original Military Demarcation Line, wherever they are consistent with the actual situation, according to our information, our side tentatively agreed to then today. The remaining portions are not completely consistent with the current actual situation. We hope that your side will make a check of those again, so that both sides can carry out the work of checking more smoothly tomorrow. If your side has nothing further to say, I propose to recess until 11 o'clock tomorrow morning.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0336.txt:As to the portions drawn with blue lines which your side returned to us, and to which you would not agree, we hope that our assistant personnel will mark those portions on our maps.\n",

            "Cleaned_data_8/0341.txt:on the maps which were returned to your side today, we have made two necessary revisions to the line of contact which our side presented to your side yesterday. First, in one place it is because of a technical error in drawing the map. The next place it is for the purpose of making the line of contact consistent with the current actual situation. With regard to the above-mentioned two revisions, I will point out respectively when I explain them. We would like to comment on the following of your proposed revisions: (Discussion over maps on table.)\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0341.txt:I would like to know your views on the comments I made this morning. I would like to know, at the same time, the result of your reconsideration of those portions of our proposed revisions to the south of the original Military Demarcation Line which your side did not accept yesterday.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0344.txt:We would like to know if your side would overprint again according to these conditions a common map for the use of both sides. It your side agrees to overprint such a map, our side is willing to show with you the expenses and to dispense with the description by latitude and longitude on the precise that a common map is used by both sides.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0345.txt:COL MURRAY: (CONT’D) overprint would be in order to produce a map which would be satisfactory to your side. This is of importance only because of the time element involved.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0345.txt:In order to determine how much change would be necessary and how long it might take, I suggest that you return the 1/50,000 map which we presented to you yesterday indicating by underlining those terrain features or villages where additional over-printing would be necessary. Do you feel that that is the proper way to proceed?\n",

            "Cleaned_data_8/0346.txt:Our information does not coincide with yours in this area. Here, we feel that the line should follow the trail. In this area, we can accept your line down to this point. By that I mean the line which you gave us this morning. From this point, we can make some minor revisions of our line, but we cannot accept your line, since as to do so would place it in the rear of our positions. We feel, too, your line is in error here, since we still have positions in this area.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0347.txt:I suggest we solve these two areas together. We would accept your line here, (points to map) with the minor revision that it follows the river here, in return for your acceptance of the river as the line of demarcation in this area.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0348.txt:I would like to know whether my understanding is correct.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0348.txt:The over-printing would be done at the same time as the Demarcation Line and boundaries of the Demilitarized Zone, as well as any necessary legends which are printed on the map. Following the printing, representatives of each side would authenticate each sheet of the map to be used in the Armistice Agreement.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0348.txt:This is an example of the manner in which the Demarcation Line could be indicated by over-printing. (Demonstrates) Legends, of course, would be in three (3) languages. We can discuss the position of the legends in the various languages and we would expect the assistance of your side in preparing the Chinese and Korean versions of the legend. We estimate that the time required for printing, once we have reached complete agreement, will be on the order of five (5) days.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0348.txt:We would also like to know how many copies of this common map your side would like to receive.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0348.txt:So far as checking and authentication of the printed map, we feel it would be advantageous if those copies which are actually appended to the Armistice Agreement are authenticated by representatives of both sides.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0352.txt:COL MURRAY: If we take as a principle that we must determine by some scientific process the actual location of the Military Demarcation Line, it would follow natural terrain features in very few instances. The line of contact is not a precise line and factors enter into its determination. There is, for example, the question of the relative height of the opposing positions. If one series of positions dominate another, the line of contact does not run midway between the two series of positions. If a large natural obstacle to movement, such as a river, runs between opposing positions, it becomes a factor in determining the line of contact. The amount and nature of troop activity, too, is a feature in determining the location of the line of contact. So, to take the view that there is a precise scientific\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0353.txt:(Refers to map.) In this instance such procedure would achieve the impracticable result of placing these small areas south of the river under the civil administration of your side. Since the actual difference here is minor I suggest that we pass on to the next point in the review of the differences.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0354.txt:COL HUANG: As to those portions, (points) to areas east and west of Pukhan River in the line proposed by your side yesterday, they are inconsistent with the actual situation. Now I would like to hear your views.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0354.txt:COL MURRAY: Since this will represent a revision to the south of the original Demarcation Line, It would be proper for your side to make a proposal to us on this area.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0356.txt:COL MURRAY: By what process do you determine the positions on the west bank of the river would exert influence not only across the entire river but also up the slopes of the far side.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0358.txt:COL HUANG: With regard to the section in the vicinity of the Puk-Han River, after making a detailed check of the actual situation, we now draw on the map the current line of contact in the area. We hope that this line can speedily be confirmed. We would like to know your views as to the other differences. Do you have any new opinions?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0358.txt:COL MURRAY: (Drawing line on map.) We think this would be correct. The line should run north of this group of hills.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0358.txt:COL MURRAY: There is no change in our views here. There has, however, been a change in positions up here. (Indicates on map.) We would like to ask you to check your information on this locality, in other words, Hill 351.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0359.txt:Attack begets counter-attack, and counter-attacks in turn land to further counter-attacks. The action of any one side in seeking to improve its position during the negotiation of the Demarcation Line could easily lead to a situation which would delay the determination of the line indefinitely. We think it preferable to settle the line on the basis of the present dispositions. The alternative is to postpone the finalization of the line at the risk of renewed military activity on the part of both sides and possibly a prolonged delay in the completion of the negotiation of the line.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0360.txt:We hope that your side will make a check of the situation and we would like to hear your comments.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0361.txt:COL MURRAY: Since there are several points along the line where our information is not consistent, it appears that it may be necessary to actually visit those spots to determine where the Line of Demarcation is to fall. This would be a time consuming method of determining the location of the Demarcation Line, but where there is no flexibility to give and take over the conference table, it is perhaps the only way that remains.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0361.txt:COL MURRAY: How would you suggest settling Hill 351? You say you are on it. We say that we are on it.\n",

            "Cleaned_data_8/0362.txt:COL HUANG: In our negotiation for determining the Military Demarcation Line, we should not forget the principle of determining the Military Demarcation Line in accordance with the actual line of contact. On the basis of this principle, our side is willing at any time to study and consider your views. If your side has any constructive proposal, We would like to hear it at any time.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0364.txt:COL HUANG: Our side agrees to review the differences along the entire line. Now, I would like to hear your views. (Discussion over maps.)\n",

            "Cleaned_data_8/0370.txt:COL HUANG: Yesterday, we proposed this line, but the change occurred in this arca, so I propose that this line be affirmed. I also would like to point out that although a change occurred here yesterday, we are willing to make a concession and not propose a further revision.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0371.txt:COL HUANG (CONT'D): The assistant personnel of our side would like to discuss with your assistant personnel as regards to printing of the common map.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0371.txt:(Points at map.) If both sides were to take this attitude with respect to these places where the information of the two sites differ, we could reach an agreement only by a joint inspection on the ground. If both sides took this attitude with respect to these points where the interpretation of the available information differs, there would be no way to resolve those differences. Thus, if we are to get an agreement there must be mutual adjustment. In this spirit, we are willing to try to reach an agreement today along the general lines of your proposal. To this end we would consider acceding to your views in their entirety at the following points. If you are willing to accept our interpretation of the line of contact at two (2) points. That is, we are willing to accept your versions on this point, this point, this point, this point, this point, this point, here, here, and here to here, provided you accept our interpretation here, and here.

            "Cleaned_data_8/0378.txt:COL MURRAY: Our original estimate was that it would take five (5) days to complete the printing of the maps. We did not, at that time, give consideration to checking of the proof by your side prior to printing, but if this stop is accomplished quickly by your side, we feel that it, too, might be accomplished within the five (5) day period. That is, the printing, including the checking of the galley proof by your side, can be completed within the five (5) day period.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0379.txt:COL HUANG: I agree to your proposal for a recess but before recessing, I want to bring up another matter. On 12 June, our side handed to you a copy of one of our maps. We would like your side to return this copy of the map to us.\n",

We consider that the method which was followed during the last revision of the line is a suitable method to use on this occasion.

            "Cleaned_data_8/0381.txt:COL HUANG: Our side agrees to your proposed method for the procedure of the revision of the Military Demarcation Line and the Demilitarized Zone. We have prepared a copy of the maps. On this map we use the black to show the Military Demarcation Line which was determined on June 17. We use the red line to show the revisions to the south of the original Demarcation Line which should be made in accordance with the change of the situation on the battlefield. These revisions are made on the basis of the information available to us at the present time, I would like to hear your comments. Now I present to you the map. (map handed over to Col Murray)\n",

We reserve the right, however, based upon our examination of the proposed southward revisions, to propose northward revisions reflecting the actual line of contact. In other words, there are certain points where revisions would be warranted. But we do not intend to propose such revisions unless our evaluation of your proposed southward revision indicates this action to be necessary. Now would your side care to Comment on the format of the proof of the common map and indicate any errors or any changes which should be made.\n",

            "Cleaned_data_8/0384.txt:The second problem relates to the width of the map. The specifications you gave to us requested that the width of the nap be increased to fifty-eight (58) centimeters. We can produce a map fifty-eight (58) centimeters wide, but the number of processes capable of printing this width is limited. Thus the time required to produce the maps in a width of fifty-eight (58) centimeters will be much greater than would be needed to produce our standard size. Unless the time factor is important, or the importance of the width of the map outweighs the importance of the time factor, we would like your concurrence in producing the map in the standard width.\n",

There is, of course, no obligation involved and the proofs could be rejected provided they are inconsistent with the situation at the time agreement is reached on the date of signing.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0392.txt:COL MURRAY: Should you reach a conclusion on the proposal I have just made, we would like to initial the four sheets of the map during this interval.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0395.txt:COL HUANG: (CONT’D) <info=splitword, word=ences> between both sides which remain to be settled. As a matter of fact, according to our proposed over all settlement which our side proposed yesterday afternoon, if your side also adopts the attitude of being realistic and settling the question the same as our side, these differences would have been settled reasonably, that have been delayed until today.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0397.txt:COL MURRAY: My interruption this morning was designed to prevent the presentation of a proposal the discussion of which would only be embarassing to both sides.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0397.txt:COL HUANG: I would like to know what time is your side prepared to resume the meeting.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0397.txt:COL HUANG: I would like to know on what kind of information your proposed revision is based.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0398.txt:COL HUANG: Since your side considers that the information between both sides is different, I would like to point out that this area was occupied by our troops at 1900 hours on July 13 and is still now in the hands of our troops.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0400.txt:COL HUANG: (CONT’D) your opinions with regard to the other areas. Now I would like to know whether your views are still the same as yesterday.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0401.txt:COL MURRAY: Let us say following the meeting scheduled at 1400. If you would like a precise time--1600.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0402.txt:COL HUANG: We have noted the proposal you have just made. Apparently your proposal is not made on the basis of the actual line of contact. We can draw many lines like such kind of lines on the maps every day. But it will be of no help to settling the differences between both sides. In the last meeting of yesterday, both sides should have been able to have determine the entire Military Demarcation Line under our proposal. It was simply because your side wanted to reserve two more areas that the question was brought on until today. However, your side not only has made no effort to close the settlement of those areas reserved by your side, but even proposed changes to the position of the various issues where your side indicated agreement yesterday. Thus, despite the continuous efforts made by our side, there has been no progress at today's meeting. Further, we find that your side has approached the direct opposite to that of achieving an agreement. This is very ridiculous. Your side specifically advocates the signing of the Armistice Agreement on July 24. However, until today, your side is still unwilling to determine the Military Demarcation Line. This is hard to be understood. Our side has made great efforts for the early determination of the Military Demarcation Line, We consider that a determination of the entire Military Demarcation Line should no longer be delayed provided both sides endeavor to realize an early Armistice on a realistic basis. As to how the present differences between both sides can be settled speedily, it is entirely up to your side. I propose that your side will give serious consideration to our proposed method of the overall settlement which our side proposed today. I would like to know if your side has any further constructive opinions.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0404.txt:COL HUANG: We are prepared to indicate on the map a method of settlement which we proposed today. I wonder if your side would like--.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0404.txt:COL MURRAY: If this is the method you proposed last night, it is not applicable. If you have a proposal based on the situation as it exists today we would be very happy to see it. To get an idea of the content of your proposal, here is your line of contact, yet today you admitted we have positions here, here, and here. (Points at mep.) So you would make a concession on this line. (Points at map.) Is this a realistic solution?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0405.txt:COL MURRAY: Your efforts are very clear indeed. You have no troops this side of the river in this area. How can make concessions? You would trade us the area that our troops hold here for areas our troops hold on the flanks. If we are going to solve the question as the basis of\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0406.txt:COL MURRAY: Then your defenses are well forward of the hill. In fact, it does not seem that your defenses would be that far forward on a hill.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0407.txt:COL MURRAY, I agree that it would be no help to continue such argument. I will indicate a possible solution to this situation. In proposing this solution I concede that your information may be better than ours in same cases, and vice versa, our information may be better than yours.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0409.txt:COL MURRAY: This is very embarrassing. It will require two (2) or three (3) days after we reach agreement on these maps before the Armistice can be signed. Because of this I accepted your proposal as a basis for discussion. I stated that I would accept your line here, here, and here, (indicates line) provided you would accept this modification and this modification. You returned to the conference table and tell us that you accept our line here, our line here. (Indicates the same lines.) But you are unable to accept this and this (Indicates the modifications). In other words, in the interest of getting agreement I offered you the shirt off my back. In place of accepting it gracefully, you returned to the conference table and asked for my drawers.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0409.txt:COL MURRAY: We consider that there may be some advantage to using the river as the Demarcation Line in this area. As a counter-proposal to your proposal we would concede your original Iine in this position and your line in that position for this position and your concession here.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0410.txt:COL MURRAY: To integrate this area into the over all proposal we would suggest that your side take its preference between this position and this position.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0410.txt:COL MURRAY: Your side would have its choice in accepting your version here or your version here.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0411.txt:COL MURRAY: We have indicated a method by which we can determine the accuracy of the information which has been used by the two (2) sides in these negotiations with respect to one of the areas. We prefer to use this method in preference to drawing a Demarcation Line in the rear of our positions. Your current proposal is that we accept your version here, here, here, and here. (indicates areas on map) for a small concession in this area. In other words we would accept your version in four and one-half (4½) out of five (5) areas. You would accept our version in one-half (½) out of five (5) areas, I think it is more reasonable for each side to accept two (2) out of four (4) areas and settle the fifth on the basis of a situation which we can determine on the ground.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0411.txt:Let us reevaluate the original proposal of our side. We proposeto give you one-two-three out of five (5) areas in this region. In return you would concede only two (2). These facts speak for themselves.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0412.txt:COL MURRAY: We request a recess until such time as we will inform you. In the meantime we would like to have you consider again a proposal in which we made four (4) concessions out of six (6) areas in which there is a difference, or the alternate proposal under which we will settle all portions of the line tonight except the one (1) area we are capable of visiting to settle it on the ground tomorrow.\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0413.txt:COL MURRAY: In order that the Armistice may not be held up, are you willing to reach an understanding on the other places along the line, leaving this to be settled at a future time based on the exact situation? The present impasse results solely from your efforts to draw a Demarcation Line to the rear of our Main Life of Resistance in a very small area. It should be possible for us to agree on the rest of the line tonight and work this area out on the 1/25,000th scale or larger map tomorrow so that there will be no question as to where the Line should be. In that way the production of maps would not be\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0414.txt:I have one more question which I would like if your side would give us an answer. How long would it take to have the common map on which was indicated the revised Military Demarcation Line and the Demilitarized Zone completed? When will our side be able to check the galley proof?\n",
            "Cleaned_data_8/0415.txt:COL HUANG: I would also like to know when the galley proof will be brought here or checking after they have been printed. If no error is found in checking, how long will it take to print the map for the signing?\n"
